📊 Crypto Clustering with Unsupervised Machine Learning
---
## 🧠 Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market performance. Using a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering, we reduce the dimensionality of crypto market data and visualize the resulting clusters in 3D. This helps identify patterns and similarities among different coins beyond just price or name recognition.
